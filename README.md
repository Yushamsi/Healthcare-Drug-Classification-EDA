# Healthcare-Drug-Classification-EDA

## Overview
This repository hosts a comprehensive analysis aimed at understanding drug persistency as prescribed by physicians for ABC pharma company. The project includes extensive data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model selection stages to predict the Persistency_Flag of a drug.

## Project Description
- **Problem Statement**: ABC pharma company faces challenges in understanding drug persistency based on physician prescriptions.
- **Objective**: Develop a classification model to automate the identification of factors influencing drug persistency.

## Key Contents
1. **Data Cleaning + EDA Analysis.ipynb**
   - Detailed exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns, trends, and insights.
   - Data cleaning processes including the removal of special characters and whitespace from column names.
   - Basic validation checks and transformations to prepare the data for modeling.
2. **Model Selection.ipynb**
   - Comparison and selection of machine learning models using various techniques including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost models.
   - Evaluation of models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.

## Key Processes
- **Data Preparation**: Structured cleaning and transformation of data to ensure quality and readiness for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Comprehensive analysis to understand the underlying patterns and behaviors in the data.
- **Model Development and Selection**: Strategic development of multiple model types and selection based on performance metrics.

## Results
- **Model Performance**: Best performing model details including metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.
- **Insights and Findings**: Key insights from EDA that influence the model's performance and business decisions.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For all computational and data manipulation tasks.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive development and documentation of the analysis process.
